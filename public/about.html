<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hello! World?</h2>
<p>I'am Marc Francis Surban but you can call me 'Marc' or 'Francis' (if you prefer two syllables). I'am an aspiring Web/Fullstack Developer from the Philippines. Only 31 years old (yea too young right? xD) and still want to learn more about programming and its innovations/evolution.</p>

<p>I'm previously a Copyeditor for Straive Philippines and have been there for 9 years. Now, trying my best to be knowledgable on the latest updates of Web development. As a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, i have a lot of knowledge in this topic and is confident that my transition (or return) to Web development will be smooth.</p>

<p>Hope you find this introduction well and i'll be happy if you could provide some feed back. Thank you! Keep safe always!</p>
