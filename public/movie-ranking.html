<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This is the movie that really touched my heart for its amazing story telling and real-life scenarios.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I really am a sci-fi movie/tv series fan, because these kind of movies really make you think on the scientific/hidden part of our world.</p>
<h3>Fast and the Furious</h3>
